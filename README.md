# DCScript
A terrible lang I wrote for fun

Features:
  - Flow control with `if` and `go`
  - `%variables = true`
  - ```
    functions:
        print With %ARG_0
        call functions recursion!
    ```
  - Make-like syntax
  - Include other files with `@include`
  - Working on an stdlib
  - Use python statements inline with `pyval` and import python packages with `@import`
  - A language in 140 lines!
